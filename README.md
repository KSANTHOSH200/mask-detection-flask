Hi!, welcome to the repository. This is a fun project developed to get better insights on Computer Vision and Image Classification. We developed MobileNetV2 based model to identify if a person is wearing a mask or not. It is a simple web application developed with the help of Flask. The model is binary classification type model with classes respectively as With Mask or Without Mask

<h1>Getting Started</h1>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

<h1>Prerequisites</h1>
Before initializing with this project you must know the following concepts:

Machine Learning - Classification
Deep Learning - Neural Networks, CNN Networks, TensorFlow(TF2)
Transfer Learning
Computer Vision - OpenCV Library
Web Application Development - Flask, Jinja Templates

<h1>To train model with custom dataset</h1>
If you want a custom dataset for your model follow these steps:-

Download your dataset
1)Categorize your dataset in two folders named with_mask and without_mask
2)Put these two folders inside dataset folder inside project's home directory
3)Use this file to train your model

<h1>Executing the Project</h1>
Execute app.py to start web application
